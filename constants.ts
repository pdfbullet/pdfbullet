    date: 'September 5, 2025',
    excerpt: "An analysis of Nepal's social media regulation landscape, the Supreme Court's directive for platform registration, and the profound consequences of the 2025 ban on creators, businesses, and citizens.",
    content: `<h2>Background of Social Media Regulation in Nepal</h2><p>Nepal’s social media landscape reflects broader global challenges in balancing digital freedom with regulation. The government argues that registration is essential to curb fake accounts, cybercrime, and misinformation. Civil society, however, stresses that such regulation risks suppressing free expression and innovation. The Supreme Court’s directive mandating registration marked a turning point. For the first time, platforms were told that without compliance, they could not legally operate in Nepal. Notices began in 2023, culminating in the ban of 2025. This has profound consequences. Content creators relying on monetization are hit hard, ISPs face losses, and ordinary citizens lose vital communication tools. Migrant families especially suffer, as many rely on these apps to stay connected.</p><p>Nepal’s social media landscape reflects broader global challenges in balancing digital freedom with regulation.

<h3>2. SMS Method (Nepal Telecom)</h3>
<p>If you don’t have internet access or if the websites are down, you can easily check your result by sending an SMS from your NTC SIM card.</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>Open your phone’s messaging app.</li>
    <li>Compose a new message and type: <strong>NEB &lt;space&gt; Your_Symbol_Number</strong></li>

    <li>For example: If your symbol number is 12345678, you would type <strong>NEB 12345678</strong>.</li>
    <li>Shortly after, you will receive an SMS with your GPA and overall result.</li>
</ol>
<div class="my-4 p-4 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900/50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 text-yellow-800 dark:text-yellow-300">
    <strong>Did You Know?</strong> Over 400,000 students appear for the NEB Class 12 exam every year in Nepal. That’s why websites often slow down or crash on result day. Using SMS, USSD, or apps like Khalti and eSewa can help you get results faster without delay!
</div>


<h3>3. IVR Method (Interactive Voice Response)</h3>
<p>Another offline option is to call the IVR system from any NTC mobile or landline to listen to your result.</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>Dial <strong>1601</strong> from your NTC phone.</li>
    <li>Follow the voice instructions provided by the operator.</li>
    <li>Enter your symbol number when prompted.</li>
    <li>Wait for a few moments as the system announces your result.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4. USSD Code Service</h3>
<p>You can also use the USSD service to check your grade 12 result. This method is fast and does not require an internet connection or balance (it's free on the NTC network).</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>Open your phone's dialer.</li>
    <li>Dial <strong>*1601#</strong> and press the call button.</li>
    <li>Follow the on-screen instructions that appear.</li>
    <li>Enter your symbol number.</li>
    <li>Your result will be instantly displayed on your phone screen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>Open the Khalti or eSewa app on your smartphone.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the 'Education' or 'NEB Result' section (it's usually on the homepage during result season).</li>
    <li>Enter your symbol number and date of birth.</li>
    <li>Tap the 'View Result' button to see your marksheet.</li>
</ol>

    title: 'The best free graphic design software: 32 must-have tools (2025)',
    date: 'January 4, 2024',
    excerpt: 'Explore graphic design tools ranging from color pallets & AI image generators to photo editing software & file management tools.',
    content: `<p>Looking for the best free graphic design tools? We’ve done the research so you don’t have to. Check out this list containing some of the best tools for creating professional designs without the professional price tags.</p>
<p>The difficulty levels of the tools varies from motivated amateurs to perfectionist professionals, so you can choose the graphic design software that suits your needs and level.</p>
<p>This post will break down the graphic design software tools into 10 useful categories, from AI image generators to file management tools.</p>
<h2>AI image generators</h2>
<p>Text-to-image generators are a hot topic that’s taking off in 2023. Artificial intelligence is changing the way we approach graphic design, and proving to be controversial in its journey.</p>
<p>These powerful tools use machine learning algorithms to create unique and eye-catching graphics in just a few clicks. Whether you're looking to generate patterns, logos, or photo-realistic images - AI image generators are captivating creative tools.</p>
<p>The software might not give you the perfect professional results every time as we are still in the early stages of this AI explosion. Nevertheless, these tools show incredible potential and can be used for content creation or to push your ideas and imagination to the max.</p>
<h3>DALL-E from OpenAI</h3>
<p>DALL-E from OpenAI (the same people who made the headline-smashing ChatGPT) is a clear front-runner in the race for AI image generators. The free AI image tool is great at taking precise inputs to create multiple variations that let you select the best from the bunch.</p>
<p>It’s most effective when choosing a style for the images, for example an expressive oil painting, a pencil drawing, or a watercolor painting. This feature makes it possible to create unique, professional-looking images with ease.</p>
<p>The software is being updated and improved on a regular basis, so keep watching these AI image generators as many changes and new features are undoubtedly around the corner.</p>
<img src="https://www.ilovepdf.com/storage/blog/205-1678104291-6.-Dalle.png" alt="DALL-E AI Image Generator" class="my-4 rounded-lg shadow-md" />
<h3>Midjourney</h3>
<p>Midjourney creates high-quality designs compared to many of its competitors, with styles that are futuristic and atmospheric. Considering the early stages of the development, like DALL-E, it’s incredible how far these tools have come in such a short amount of time with such impressive results.</p>
<p>However, despite its impressive capabilities, the biggest drawback is its usability. The process to create an image is complicated and time-consuming—you have to enter Discord, find a new “newbies channel”, and then use the “/imagine” command in a chaotic chat with images flying through the chat.</p>
<p>Aside from the difficult usability, once you have understood the process the results of this AI art generator are remarkable.</p>
<h3>DeepAI</h3>
<p>DeepAI is fun AI image generator that lacks some finishing touches. It’s a great tool to get some inspiration on specific ideas, with a simple search bar that is easy to use, and a number of free styles to choose from.</p>
<p>While the results produced by its text-to-image converter may not be as polished and professional as those produced by other AI image generators. DeepAI has a lot of potential, and is a playful tool with a number of free styles to choose from, giving users plenty to experiment with.</p>
<h2>Color palette generators</h2>
<p>This chapter is all about color. We'll explore the best free graphic design software options specifically made to help you create stunning color palettes.</p>
<p>Whether you're a seasoned designer or just starting out, these tools make it easy to experiment with color, select a harmonious scheme, and set the scene for your color scheme. So, let's dive in and discover the best free color palette tools.</p>
<h3>Coolors</h3>
<p>See what’s hot with trending color palettes, generate colors, and select colors from photos with this well-designed website that helps you get into the creative mood from the get-go. Coolors is easy to use and palettes are simple to export, with many options for sharing your chosen colors.</p>
<p>Whether you want to find warm color palettes and share them with your team or save them for future projects, this tool has a smooth workflow that makes it easy to work on multiple new projects while organizing the old ones.</p>
<img src="https://www.ilovepdf.com/storage/blog/205-1678103451-1.-Coolors.png" alt="Coolors Color Palette Generator" class="my-4 rounded-lg shadow-md" />
<h3>Color Space</h3>
<p>Color Space is a useful color palette generator to develop your ideas for a design that starts with a single color. Put your desired color in and the site generates a variety of color palettes including gradient and random shades.</p>
<p>It’s simple to create basic gradients, and has recently released the option to make 3 Color Gradients, which are extremely easy to edit and play around with.</p>
<p>The drawback is that you are limited in the amount of palettes that you can explore, especially if you’re starting from scratch and don’t have a color palette already in mind.</p>
<h3>Adobe Capture</h3>
<p>Adobe Capture is a color palette generator that offers ten free tasks before having to register. This is a superb mobile app that takes real-time images and lets you create a color palette from whatever you see around you.</p>
<p>The app is a useful addition that makes it easy to generate a color palette from an image, whether you choose to use a live camera view or select a saved photo. You can also create shapes and patterns as interesting artistic features.</p>
<h2>Image editing tools</h2>
<p>Photo editing is an essential aspect of graphic design. Whether it's adjusting the angle, changing the brightness and contrast, or adding special filters, having the right image editing software makes all the difference to your final results.</p>
<p>In this section, we'll explore some of the best free image editors available to help elevate your design work and give it that professional touch. Image editing tools can be difficult to use, so we've also included some that are more straightforward.</p>
<h3>iLoveIMG Editor</h3>
<p>The iLoveIMG's Photo Editor is by far the easiest of these free photo editing software. It is a simple yet versatile tool with a range of editing options that allow you to draw on images and add more image files. Users can easily crop, resize, add filters, frames, and effects to add a professional finish to designs.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a basic photo editor that’s easy and quick to use for some basic editing, then this is the perfect option.</p>
<img src="https://www.ilovepdf.com/storage/blog/205-1678103763-2.1-iLoveIMG-Edit-tool.png" alt="iLoveIMG Photo Editor" class="my-4 rounded-lg shadow-md" />
<h3>Photopea</h3>
<p>Acting as a close alternative to Photoshop, Photopea is an online tool that provides many design features, without the need to download any expensive software.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that as an online tool it may run slowly if you’re working with heavy editing tasks. Also, if you are used to other editing software then it will take some time to learn its features.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Photopea is a fantastic free editing tool for designers who want professional features to bring their creative visions to life.</p>
<img src="https://www.ilovepdf.com/storage/blog/205-1678103850-2.-Photopea.png" alt="Photopea Online Editor" class="my-4 rounded-lg shadow-md" />
<h3>GIMP</h3>
<p>GIMP is a fantastic open-source image editing software that provides powerful image editing tools and offers an impressive variety of file formats, all completely free.</p>
<p>The workspace is slightly cluttered and it can be difficult to navigate all of the features, especially for beginners, but once you’ve mastered the basics this is an amazing feature-packed photo editor and another free alternative to Photoshop.</p>
<h3>Adobe creative cloud (free trial)</h3>
<p>Adobe graphic design software isn’t the easiest if you’re just starting out, but it takes the top spot for the most in-depth software for image and video editing.</p>
<p>For professionals, this is the industry standard for quality editing, and within the Creative Cloud you have access to multiple Adobe products, including Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere Pro just to name a few.</p>
<p>Perfect if you aren’t needing them long term, there are free trials for many of the tools. While a 7-day free trial is available, the software can be expensive if you’re looking for a longer-term editing solution.</p>
<h2>Font generators</h2>
<p>Welcome to the world of font generators. For anyone working or playing around with designs, typography plays a crucial role in making your work stand out with the right style.</p>
<p>Free font generators help you find custom typefaces for your projects without the need for extensive design knowledge and expensive font licenses. Experiment with different styles and letterforms until you find the perfect look for your design.</p>
<h3>Fontspring</h3>
<p>Fontspring offers multiple categories that help you find the right free font download. It is also simple to sort the fonts by ‘Most Favorited’ to see what’s trending, as well as 'Best Of’ lists to investigate the most popular selection from previous years.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, when browsing the fonts some are listed as containing free versions when in reality they are only available as icons, which is misleading. If you don’t mind spending time finding the free ones, this is a valuable resource.</p>
<img src="https://www.ilovepdf.com/storage/blog/205-1678105548-3.-Fontspring.png" alt="Fontspring Font Generator" class="my-4 rounded-lg shadow-md" />

<p>WhatTheFont (also known as MyFonts) has high-quality downloads that are searchable within useful categories. Are you trying to identify a font you’ve spotted? MyFonts can also scan an uploaded image to find and identify the font you want to identify.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, free fonts are often hidden among the paid options, requiring you to scroll through the listings to download the font you need. Despite this, MyFonts remains a great tool for anyone looking for a free font generator.</p>
<h3>Google Fonts</h3>
<p>Google Fonts provides an extremely popular free font browser that offers typography in multiple languages and design styles. There is a user-friendly interface that offers fonts that are free for personal and commercial use.</p>
<p>A drawback is that the range of types is not as diverse as other font browsers, with limited options within a chosen fonts style. If you're looking for a more specific font style, you may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Icon downloads</h2>
<p>Icons play a critical role in creating a professional and polished look for websites, mobile applications, and other digital platforms. In this section, we'll be exploring the best free icon downloads so you can find the perfect designs for your next project.</p>
<p>From modern designs and classic looks to simple social media icon downloads - the ability to browse and use royalty-free icons is key for any digital designer or marketer looking to create a cohesive brand experience.</p>

<p>This 2D animation software offers a wide range of tools and functions, including customizable color palettes, layers, frame management, and more. That being said, for more professional applications, it's unlikely to have all the features and tools required.</p>
<h3>Animaker</h3>
<p>Animaker is another tool that makes it easy to get started with 3D animation software. It has a lot of template characters and customization options that can build a professional final project, as well as sharing options that let you integrate it with other programs.</p>

    content: `<h2>Why Add a Password to Your PDF?</h2>
<p>In an age where data privacy is paramount, protecting your documents is more important than ever. Whether you're sharing confidential business reports, sending personal identification, or archiving sensitive financial records, adding a password provides a critical layer of security. It ensures that only authorized individuals with the correct password can open and view the contents of your PDF file.</p>
<p>Password protection uses encryption to scramble the data within the PDF, making it unreadable without the key (your password). This is the most effective way to prevent unauthorized access and maintain confidentiality.</p>

<h2>How to Password Protect a PDF Online for Free</h2>
<p>Our <a href="/protect-pdf" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">Protect PDF tool</a> offers a simple, fast, and secure way to encrypt your files. Follow these easy steps:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li><strong>Go to the Protect PDF tool:</strong> Navigate to the tool page to get started.</li>
    <li><strong>Upload your PDF file:</strong> Select the PDF document you want to secure from your device, Google Drive, or Dropbox.</li>
    <li><strong>Set a strong password:</strong> In the options panel on the right, type your desired password. You will be asked to type it a second time to confirm and avoid typos. Choose a password that is strong and not easily guessable.</li>
    <li><strong>Click 'Protect PDF':</strong> Once you've set your password, click the button to start the encryption process.</li>
    <li><strong>Download your secure file:</strong> Your PDF is now password-protected. Click the download button to save it. Anyone who tries to open this file will now be prompted to enter the password you set.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Your Security is Our Priority</h2>
<p>We understand the importance of the documents you process with us. The entire password protection process is handled securely. Your files are uploaded over an encrypted connection, and they are automatically and permanently deleted from our servers within a few hours. This guarantees that your privacy is always respected.</p>
<p>Using our "Protect PDF" tool is the perfect way to share documents with peace of mind, knowing that your sensitive information is safe.</p>`,

    title: 'Are digital signatures legally binding?',
    date: 'August 1, 2025',
    excerpt: 'Digital signatures are a top choice for cross-border business transactions. But are they legally binding? The short answer is yes, in many parts of the world. This guide explains the legal frameworks, the technology behind them, and how our Sign PDF tool can help.',
    content: `<h2>The Short Answer: Yes, They Are.</h2>
<p>In an increasingly digital world, signing documents electronically has become the norm. But a common question remains: are digital signatures actually legally binding? The short answer is yes, in most countries around the world, digital signatures carry the same legal weight as a traditional handwritten signature. Laws like the <strong>ESIGN Act</strong> in the United States and the <strong>eIDAS Regulation</strong> in the European Union have established solid legal frameworks that validate their use in commerce and legal proceedings.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Difference: Electronic vs. Digital Signatures</h2>
<p>While often used interchangeably, there's a key distinction between a standard "electronic signature" and a more secure "digital signature."</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>An <strong>electronic signature</strong> can be as simple as a typed name at the end of an email or an image of a handwritten signature. It indicates intent to sign but has limited security.</li>
    <li>A <strong>digital signature</strong> is a highly secure type of electronic signature. It uses cryptographic technology to embed a unique, verifiable 'fingerprint' into the document. This makes it far more secure and legally robust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Three Pillars of a Secure Digital Signature</h2>
<p>A true digital signature provides three critical guarantees that make it legally sound:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> It cryptographically verifies that the person signing is who they claim to be, preventing forgery.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> It creates a tamper-evident seal. If the document is altered in any way after being signed, the signature becomes invalid.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> The cryptographic link between the signature and the document means the signer cannot later deny their involvement in the signing process.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How I Love PDFLY Helps</h2>
<p>Our <a href="/sign-pdf" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">Sign PDF tool</a> is designed to create secure and verifiable digital signatures. It provides a complete audit trail, including timestamps and IP addresses, which strengthens the legal standing of your signed documents. Whether you're signing a simple agreement or a critical business contract, our tool provides the security and validity you need.</p>

<h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
<p>While digital signatures are widely accepted, regulations can vary by jurisdiction and the nature of the document. For highly sensitive or regulated transactions, it's always a good practice to consult with a legal professional to ensure full compliance with local laws. For the vast majority of business and personal needs, a secure digital signature provides a reliable and legally binding solution.</p>`,

    title: 'Smart OCR tips: how to get the most out of your scanned documents',
    date: 'July 31, 2025',
    excerpt: 'Boost your OCR results with smart scanning techniques. Learn how resolution, contrast, and language support affect text recognition accuracy. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a powerful technology, but its accuracy depends on the quality of the source image. This guide provides tips on how to scan your documents to achieve the best possible OCR results, ensuring your text is searchable and selectable with high fidelity.',
    content: `<h2>Why Scan Quality is Everything for OCR</h2>
<p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a fantastic technology that transforms flat, non-interactive images of text (like a scanned document) into fully searchable, selectable, and editable text. It's the magic behind making your paper archives digital. However, the accuracy of OCR is highly dependent on one thing: the quality of the source scan. A blurry, skewed, or low-resolution scan will result in jumbled text and poor recognition. To get the most out of our <a href="/ocr-pdf" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">OCR PDF tool</a>, follow these smart scanning tips.</p>

<h2>1. Aim for the Right Resolution (DPI)</h2>
<p>DPI, or Dots Per Inch, is a measure of a scanner's resolution. For OCR, the sweet spot is generally <strong>300 DPI</strong>. Here’s why:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li><strong>Too Low (e.g., 150 DPI):</strong> The characters might be too pixelated for the OCR engine to recognize them accurately, leading to errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Just Right (300 DPI):</strong> This provides enough detail for clear character recognition without creating an unnecessarily large file. It's the industry standard for archiving documents.</li>
    <li><strong>Too High (e.g., 600+ DPI):</strong> While it provides more detail, it often doesn't significantly improve OCR accuracy for standard text and results in a much larger file size, which takes longer to process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Optimize Contrast and Brightness</h2>
<p>Clarity is key. The OCR engine works best when there is a sharp contrast between the text and the background. The ideal document is crisp black text on a clean white background.</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li><strong>Adjust Scanner Settings:</strong> Before scanning, use your scanner's preview function to adjust brightness and contrast. Increase the contrast to make the text darker and the background whiter.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Shadows and Stains:</strong> Ensure your document is flat on the scanner bed to avoid shadows. Stains, wrinkles, or highlighter marks can interfere with recognition, so use the cleanest copy of the document you can find.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Keep it Straight (Deskewing)</h2>
<p>A document that was scanned at an angle (skewed) can be difficult for an OCR engine to read. The lines of text should be perfectly horizontal.</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li><strong>Align Carefully:</strong> Take an extra second to make sure your paper is aligned perfectly with the guides on your scanner.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Auto-Straighten Features:</strong> Most modern scanners and our OCR tool have a "deskew" or "auto-straighten" feature. Make sure it's enabled to automatically correct slight misalignments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Choose the Right Color Mode</h2>
<p>Your scanner will likely offer three modes: Color, Grayscale, and Black & White (Monochrome).</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li><strong>Black & White (Monochrome):</strong> This is the best option for simple, high-contrast text documents. It produces the smallest file size and the sharpest distinction between text and background.</li>
    <li><strong>Grayscale:</strong> Use this if your document has light-colored text or images with shades of gray that are important.</li>
    <li><strong>Color:</strong> Only use this mode if the color of the text or images is essential to the document's meaning. It produces the largest file size and can sometimes reduce contrast for standard black text.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Select the Correct Language</h2>
<p>An OCR engine uses a dictionary and character set specific to a language to achieve the best results. If you're scanning a document in French, telling the OCR tool that the language is French will allow it to recognize characters like 'é', 'à', and 'ç' correctly.</p>
<p>Our <a href="/ocr-pdf" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">OCR PDF tool</a> supports multiple languages. Always make sure you select the correct language from the options before starting the process to maximize accuracy.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: A Great Scan Means a Great Result</h2>
<p>By taking a few extra moments to prepare your documents and configure your scanner settings, you can dramatically improve the quality of your OCR results. A clean, high-contrast, 300 DPI scan will transform your paper documents into accurate, searchable, and highly usable digital files. Happy scanning!</p>`,
